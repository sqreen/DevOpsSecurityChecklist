# The Security Checklist

[https://devops-security-checklist.sqreen.io/](https://devops-security-checklist.sqreen.io/)

Security is increasingly becoming the responsibility of engineer teams. Movements like DevSecOps are contributing to this change.
This security checklist aims to give professionals a list of security best practices they can follow according to their company stage.
Engineer teams make security decisions several times, everyday! Security is a moving target. The applicable recommendations for a Series B company will not be relevant for an early stage company.
Select your company stage and use these rules to improve your security.
This list is far from being exhaustive. Feel free to contribute!

Please take a look at the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sqreen/DevOpsSecurityChecklist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.
